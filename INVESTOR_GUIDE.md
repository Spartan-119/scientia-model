## Recommended Scenarios to Explore

### üéØ **Base Case** (Current Settings)
The default values represent a realistic projection based on industry benchmarks.

### üìä **Conservative Case**
Try adjusting:
- Conversion Rate: 2%
- Viral Growth Multiplier: 1.05
- Deal Growth Rate: 15%

This shows "worst case" while still being viable.

### üöÄ **Optimistic Case**
Try adjusting:
- Conversion Rate: 5%
- Viral Growth Multiplier: 1.15
- Deal Growth Rate: 30%
- Paid User Churn: 3%

This shows "best case" with strong product-market fit.

### üè¢ **Enterprise-First Strategy**
Try adjusting:
- Enterprise Launch Month: 3
- Avg Seats/Deal: 50
- Enterprise Price: ¬£20

This shows what happens if we focus heavily on enterprise.

## Key Questions This Tool Answers

1. **What's the revenue potential?**
   - Look at Final ARR metric and Total MRR chart

2. **How important is user conversion?**
   - Adjust Conversion Rate % and watch ARR change

3. **When do we reach profitability?**
   - Compare monthly MRR to your expected operating costs

4. **What drives growth more: B2C or Enterprise?**
   - Compare the blue vs green lines in the MRR chart

5. **How sensitive is the model to churn?**
   - Adjust churn rates and see impact on final metrics

6. **What if viral growth is stronger/weaker?**
   - Modify the Viral Growth Multiplier

## Understanding the Model

### Key Assumptions

1. **Freemium Funnel**
   - Users start free
   - Convert to paid monthly at a steady rate
   - Converted users leave the free pool
   - Some paid users churn each month

2. **Viral Growth**
   - Each month, new user acquisition accelerates
   - Models word-of-mouth and network effects
   - Growth multiplier compounds monthly

3. **Enterprise Sales**
   - Launches after B2C proves product-market fit
   - Sales-driven (not viral)
   - Larger deals, lower churn
   - More predictable revenue

4. **Realistic Benchmarks**
   - 2-5% conversion is typical for SaaS freemium
   - 5-7% monthly churn is average for B2C SaaS
   - 2-3% annual churn is typical for enterprise

## Tips for Your Analysis

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Test multiple scenarios
- Look for tipping points (when does growth accelerate?)
- Consider which levers you can actually control
- Think about resource allocation (B2C vs Enterprise focus)

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Cherry-pick only the highest numbers
- Ignore churn rates (they significantly impact outcomes)
- Forget that assumptions compound over time
- Overlook the timing of enterprise launch

## Questions for Discussion

After exploring the tool, consider:

1. Which scenario seems most achievable given the team and market?
2. What are the biggest risks to these projections?
3. What would need to be true for the optimistic case?
4. How does this compare to the TAM/SAM/SOM analysis?
5. What milestones would validate these assumptions?
